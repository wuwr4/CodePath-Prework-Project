# Prework - Random Background Color 

Submitted by: WanRong Wu

Random Background Color is an app that allows the user to
randomly generate a new background color every time they click a button. 

Time spent: 3.5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [X] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Apps
1. Reddit
    - Choosing where to place my scroll button on the screen
    - Toggle between light mode and dark mode
    - Viewing past posts I've upvoted
2. YouTube
    - Very clean UI that's consistent across mobile, web, and TV
    - Pre-viewing a video before clicking into it
    - Viewing past videos I've watched
3. Gmail
    - Deleting emails with one swipe/action
    - Viewing emails from multiple accounts
    - Notifications indicating how many unread emails are currently in my inbox
    
Potential App Idea
- I would like to build an app that showcases the many different flavors of snacks that are available in grocery stores. It would be somewhat similar to a social media app, where users would be able to comment on each flavor and upvote/downvote. The most popular flavors would be promoted in the app and users would be able to suggest new flavors as they are released. Users would also be able to manage a "collection" of snacks they've tried and snacks they wish to try.

## Notes

I had a difficult time navigating the XCode user interface. As a first time user,
it was hard for me to locate the elements and functionalities referenced in the
pre-work instructions. Most of the time I used working on this project was spent on
familiarizing myself with the XCode interface.
